# **What is Git**

## **Version Control System (VSC)** for tracking changes in computer files

-   Distributed version control.
-   Coordinates work between multiple developers.

## **Concepts of Git**

-   Keeps track of code history.
-   Takes "snapshots" of your files.
-   You decide when to take a snapshot by making a "commit".
-   You can visit any snapshot at any time.
-   You can stage files before commiting.
